# Introduction
Welcome to the DirectIQ API. You can use our API to access DirectIQ data endpoints, which can get information on contacts, contact lists, templates, campaigns and reports in your account.

We have language bindings in Shell and C#. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
